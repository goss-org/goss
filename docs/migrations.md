# Migration guide

## v0.5 migration

### Log output is structured and no longer global

goss now logs through `log/slog`. The `[LEVEL]` prefix and the prefix-matching
filter behind it are gone, record messages are constant with the variable data
in attributes, and as a library goss emits nothing until it is given a logger.
`util.Config.LogLevel` has been removed: set the level on that logger's handler
instead.

See [Logging](logging.md#migrating-from-earlier-versions) for the full list of
changes and the record schema.

## v4 migration

### Array matchers (e.g. user.groups) no longer allows duplicates

Goss v0.3.X allowed:

```yaml
user:
  root:
    exists: true
    groups:
      - root
      - root
      - root
```

Goss v0.4.x, will fail with the above as group "root" is only in the slice once. However, with goss v0.4.x the array may
contain matchers. The test below is valid for v0.4.x but not valid for v0.3.x

```yaml
user:
  root:
    exists: true
    groups:
      - have-prefix: r
```

## rpm now contains the full EVR version

To enable the ability to compare RPM versions in the future, The version matching of rpm has changed

from:

```console
rpm -q --nosignature --nohdrchk --nodigest --qf '%{VERSION}\n' package_name
```

to:

```console
rpm -q --nosignature --nohdrchk --nodigest --qf '%|EPOCH?{%{EPOCH}:}:{}|%{VERSION}-%{RELEASE}\n' package_name
```

## `file.contains` -> `file.contents`

File contains attribute has been renamed to file.contents

from:

```yaml
file:
  /tmp/foo:
    exists: true
    contains: []
```

to:

```yaml
file:
  /tmp/foo:
    exists: true
    contents: []
```
